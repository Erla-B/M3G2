I used Tailwind to build the css inside the HTML for the most part.
I used @apply for some items that are recurring so that I could change the look of them in one place instead of many.
There are two pages that work, the main page and 'The Films' section. Would've liked to do more but ran out of time.
Tailwind made things somewhat easy, at least when you've gotten used to the naming, it's pretty straightforward and @apply is very useful.
I made the grid for the films responsive so it is a grid of 3 columns in larger sizes but go in a row when the screen size is smaller.
